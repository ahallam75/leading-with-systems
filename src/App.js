Expanding our understanding of how the emotional system guides our family, work, and other social systems unveils more effective options to counter issues we find problematic.'

As we learns about systems theory, we will also explore our own family systems in an effort to increase objectivity and clarity and lower our emotional responses. This is also be effective when considering organizations: their beginnings and development over time, their leadership and contributions to its membersâ€™ well-being.'

    text: 'As we increase our knowledge of theory and awareness of ourselves, we discover that the options for our responses amid increased tension and anxiety become more numerous. We learn to cope more effectively with negative reactions from others as we seek to better ourselves; symptoms cause by anxiety and stress will lessen as we grow in confidence; and a desire to continue on the path of learning theory and our history will flourish as we recognize the freedom that knowledge brings.'

    text: 'Establishing a more differentiated self is our goal, as we seek to claim who we are and what we believe without swaying to the masses. Often our sense of self is poorly differentiated, highly influenced by the acceptance and approval we seek from others. We strive to decrease our dependence on the thinking of others around us as we strengthen our own voice, staying calm and clear headed in the midst of conflict, criticism and rejection.'
